### Hi! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I have a strong background in programming, maths and problem solving. With an inquiring mind, I am always keen to learn new things and improve my acquired skills. Over the years, I have built a versatile skillset that spans from building web applications using MERN, ASP.Net and Java EE to video game development using Unity and mobile development with Java and Kotlin.
